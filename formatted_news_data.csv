897,"A team of researchers at IIT Guwahati designed a non-sticking, non-wetting liquid marble that floats in water and releases its contents in a pre-programmed time. The team has engineered liquid marbles to have a ‘time bomb’ type release effect and to conduct a spontaneous chemical reaction. Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati have developed liquid marbles using nano clay that can be pre-programmed for drug delivery and cascade chemical reactions. The nano clay marbles were made of a shell of nanoclay that holds the liquid. The researchers modified the nanoclay with either water-loving chemical groups (hydrophilic) or water-hating (hydrophobic) to programme the marbles for timed content release.

898,"Scientists have revealed that they have discovered the world’s second-deepest blue hole in Chetumal Bay, off the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. This huge underwater cavern is about 900 feet deep and its area is said to be around 147,000 square feet. Blue holes are believed to be formed during the latter ice ages around 11,000 years ago and might have answers to life on other planets. A blue hole is a massive underwater sinkhole that is hundreds of metres long, often the height of several skyscrapers and spanning areas that are bigger than cities. They are believed to be formed during the latter ice ages around 11,000 years ago because of the erosion of limestone terrains. When seawater meets limestone, water easily permeates the rocks since they are so porous. This enables chemicals in the water to react with limestone, eating it away. Once glaciers melted and seawater rose over time, water rushed into these caverns and filled them up, creating these sinkholes. Blue holes get their names from their indigo centres and light blue perimeters. In comparision, the deepest known blue hole of the world, which was discovered in 2016 in the South China Sea and is known as the Dragon Hole, is beleived to be more than 980 feet deep. The Mexico blue hole has been named Taam Ja’, which means ""deep water"" in Mayan."

There is particular interest in ‘magic number’ nuclei: containing a number of protons or neutrons such that the resulting nucleus is highly stable. The heaviest known ‘magic’ nucleus is lead (82 protons). The researchers accelerated uranium-238 nuclei into plutonium-198 nuclei at the KEK Isotope Separation System (KISS). In a process called multinucleon transfer, the two isotopes exchanged protons and neutrons. Theoretical calculations suggest that uranium-241 may have a half-life of 40 minutes. The discovery of a new neutron-rich uranium isotope is the first since 1979. Uranium is a naturally occurring chemical element with the symbol U and atomic number 92.

The storage capacity of the wetland decreased to 387.87 million cubic metres in 2020 from 2,617.5 million cubic metres in 1900.

The tribunal is headquartered in New Delhi and has regional benches in several cities across India.
